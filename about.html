                        <p>Giap Nguyen started Straight to the Point Archery in 2005. He's an avid and accomplished archer himself, having competed
                        with the United States Archery Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics. He has three children, and started Straight to the
                        Point in part because he was not satisfied with the archery eduction options for them in Tacoma. After The Hunger Games
                        books and movies came out, he noticed a surge in popularity of archery among young people, especially young women, and
                        the business has been booming ever since.</p>
